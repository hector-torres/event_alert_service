It yields 1 for identical vectors (when they point in the same direction) and 0 for orthogonal (unrelated) vectors. Dot product, on the other hand, will be higher for longer vectors even if the content is the same, so use it with care (or consider normalizing embeddings first if you want it comparable to cosine).\n"
